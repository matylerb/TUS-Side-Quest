# The Big DataBasin

Welcome to The Big DataBasin! An analytics competition that explores statistical innovations in rivers, how data that flows through a river is collected and monitored, using the Shannon as a case study.

--- 
## Background

The River Shannon is the longest and largest river in Ireland and rivers are one of the most dynamic sensors for enviromental change, therefore better analytics from uncertaintity-aware forecasting to sensor fusion and explainable anomaly detection directly improves early indicators of flooding, water-quality management and also evidence-based policies, especially for regions like the Shannon Basin.

--- 
## Your Task

**(The Guiding Question)

How can we use data to create actionable insights from river data streams and satellite imagery to directly improve monitoring, forecasting, and decision-making support for sustainable river management?

---
## Expected Outcomes / Examples

**These are some examples to help get you started

**Beginner
- Data Visualisation / Graphs / Tables (Erosion Patterns, sediment, meandering pattern, water levels over the year etc).
- Interactive Dashboard

**Intermediate
- Nowcast / Forecast: short term forecasting of river level, flow, and meandering.
- Flood Prediction, based on historical data, and weatherAPI's.

**Advanced
- Machine learning models that predicts river flow, water levels, and monitoring water quality.
- Anomaly Detection Across Multi-Sensor Streams
- Bayesian Hydrological Forecasting with Satellite Fusion

---
## Potential Considerations

- Feel free to mix-and-match any data from any instruments in your dataset.
- If you're using more than one instrument to display on your graph, make sure the data can be aggregated.

---
## Scope

**In scope
- Using open Shannon river / basin data (gauges, water quality, water levels, etc.).
- Building statistical and or machine learning models to forecast, detect anomalies, or merge data.
- Creating data visualisations.
- Building apps to display the data.

**Out of Scope
- Creating physical robots, deploying or testing robots in real water. 
- Using closed or private datasets.

**Tools
- Create and innovate on the tools that you have experience with (e.g Python) to extract, manipulate, and process the data whatever way you want within the scope. 

---
## Marking Criteria

**Innovation
- Is this research or a functional project?

- Is everything you claim accurate?

**Relevance
- Would research teams / companies / organisations be able to use these findings in real life on rivers?

**Clarity
 - How clear are your findings backed by the data?
 - Is the story behind the all the data clearly communicated?
